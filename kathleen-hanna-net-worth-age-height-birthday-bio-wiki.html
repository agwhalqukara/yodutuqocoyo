During this time she worked as a stripper to pay her tuition. “My parents didn’t go to college. I felt lucky [to attend].” While at Evergreen, with fellow student and photographer Aaron Baush-Greene, she set up a photo exhibit featuring the pair’s photography, which dealt with sexism, violence against women, and AIDS– issues that were heightened for Hanna when she volunteered for SafePlace, a domestic violence organization. However, the school administrators took the photos down before they had the chance to be viewed, an act of censorship that prompted what Hanna refers to as her “first foray into activism”: the creation of Reko Muse, an independent feminist art gallery, with friends Heidi Arbogast and Tammy Rae Carland.</p><p align=justify>She married musician in 2006.SShe married musician in 2006.hShe married musician in 2006.eShe married musician in 2006.

While Hanna never sought nor intended to become the spokeswoman for Riot Grrl, she hoped that it would provide a voice for issues that are relevant to women on local, national, and global levels.</p><p>Hanna’s outspoken feminism has always influenced her work. She became a voice for third-wave feminism and the Riot Grrrl movement in 1991.

I deserve to have control over my life and my health care.’ Imagine if a man was told, ‘You can’t make the decision to have a vasectomy.'” Hanna also spoke at the 2011 Planned Parenthood “Stand Up for Women’s Health” Rally.
