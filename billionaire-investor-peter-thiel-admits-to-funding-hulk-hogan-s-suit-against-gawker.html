Suing gossip blog Gawker for violating your privacy?&nbsp;Use PayPal co-founder, <a href=# title="Peter Thiel Net Worth">Peter Thiel</a>.</p><p>Thiel, who is also one of the earliest investors in Facebook,&nbsp;has admitted to paying about $10 million to fund&nbsp;the lawsuit Terry Bollea (a.k.a. <a href=# title="Hulk Hogan Net Worth">Hulk Hogan</a>) brought against New York-based Gawker Media, as well as other legal actions against the outlet. Hogan sued the site for $100 million after it posted a video in 2012 of him having sex with his former best friend's wife.&nbsp;A Florida jury <a href=#>awarded the wrestler $140 million</a> in March and Florida Circuit Judge Pamela Campbell <a href=#>upheld the award</a> on Wednesday.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-197296 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-514540128.jpg alt="John Pendygraft-Pool/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-197296 class=wp-caption-text>John Pendygraft-Pool/Getty Images</p><p>When the news of the Silicon Valley billionaire's bankroll came to light, Gawker wasted no time attacking Thiel. On Wednesday, the media outlet said in a statement to Huffington Post:</p><p>"According to these reports, a board member of Facebook and the Committee to Protect Journalists has been secretly funding a legal campaign against our journalists."</p><p>But the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a> reported Thiel doesn't believe his actions are contradictory:</p><p>"I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations," he said. "I think much more highly of journalists than that. It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker."</p><p>In 2007, Gawker published an article: "Peter Thiel is totally gay, people." Thiel said that article and a series of others about his friends "ruined people's lives for no reason." In a 2009 interview, Thiel described Gawker's writers as terrorists â€“ quite the admonition from a man who also <a href=#>supports Donald Trump</a>. One of his friends convinced him to use his power and money to help other victims of Gawker's coverage defend themselves against the site's attacks.</p><p>"It's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence," he said on Wednesday. "I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredible damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest."</p><p>But Owen Thomas, the author of the salacious 2007 Gawker story defended his work. (He is now the business editor at the&nbsp;San Francisco Chronicle.) He said he was merely reporting common knowledge about a public figure, and did not "out" the tech billionaire.</p><p>"I did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle," Thomas said in a phone interview with the&nbsp;Times. "I thought that attitude was retrograde and homophobic, and that informed my reporting. I believe that he was out and not in the closet."</p><p>The Silicon Valley's admitted involvement raises questions about whether Hogan had a financial interest in bringing the case to court. At the hearing before Judge Campbell on Wednesday, Seth Berlin, an attorney for Gawker, attempted to introduce printouts of the&nbsp;New York Times and other articles linking Thiel to the case. But the judge stopped him.</p><p>"I don't like looking at all the stuff that's published out there," she said. "It's not healthy."</p><p>Now that Hogan's case is moving into the appellate stage, it remains to be seen whether the Silicon Valley billionaire's bankroll will help or hurt the case. Robert Richards, a professor of First Amendment Studies at Penn State University, told the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal that while Thiel's financing is not illegal, it could set a precedent for other wealthy figures who might want to change the media landscape.</p><p>"If you have a situation now where a newspaper fears doing something that might be controversial because they don't know who is going to come out of the woodwork to sue them, I think that certainly has a chilling effect," he said.</p><p>Of course, this chilling effect is exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to guard against.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfpbK1sdFmq6GhlaF6p8HNnapmoKWhuG60zqCYp2Wjqra1ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbillionaire-investor-peter-thiel-admits-to-funding-hulk-hogan-s-suit-against-gawker.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbillionaire-investor-peter-thiel-admits-to-funding-hulk-hogan-s-suit-against-gawker.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbillionaire-investor-peter-thiel-admits-to-funding-hulk-hogan-s-suit-against-gawker.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbillionaire-investor-peter-thiel-admits-to-funding-hulk-hogan-s-suit-against-gawker.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbillionaire-investor-peter-thiel-admits-to-funding-hulk-hogan-s-suit-against-gawker.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbillionaire-investor-peter-thiel-admits-to-funding-hulk-hogan-s-suit-against-gawker.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./faz%C4%B1l-say-overview-2024-wiki-real-name-age-height-family-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./faz%C4%B1l-say-overview-2024-wiki-real-name-age-height-family-and-more.html>Fazl Say Overview 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family And More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-tobias-fate-dating-tobias-fate-s-girlfriend-exes.html>Who is Tobias Fate Dating Tobias Fate's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-tobias-fate-dating-tobias-fate-s-girlfriend-exes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
