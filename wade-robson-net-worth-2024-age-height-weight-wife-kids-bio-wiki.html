At the age of 12, he was already teaching dance classes in Hollywood and secured his first choreography job at the age of 14. At such age and already a boss, many clients would be reluctant taking orders from what they would describe as “skinny white kid.”</p><p>Robson, while still a teenager he choreographed spears Pepsi commercials most notable ones being the NSYNC and 2001 Super Bowl. He also directed spears 1999-200 world tours; I’m a slave four u video&nbsp; NSYNC’s 2000 No strings Attached tour, Dream Within a Dream Tour, among others.</p><p>Robson has also had a television career where he was the host of MTV’s The Wade Robson Project.

He has made his money by being a dancer, musician, songwriter, film producer, film director, and perhaps what he is known best choreography.
