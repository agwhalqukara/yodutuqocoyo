We think of Sue Bird. Being a popular name in the sports field, she has gathered herself fair amount of attention. These days, rumors about Sue being a lesbian is firing up the media.</span></p><h2>Are these Gay/Lesbian Rumors True? Let's find out:</h2><p>This hiding nature of Sue brought her questions about her sexual orientation and rumors of her being lesbian. Being a female basketball player her posts on Social Medias with girls are more than boys and this may be also the reason of the rumors.</p><p>Sue Bird is a well-known athlete who has successfully won the hearts of people by the skills she acquires in the ground. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=198 style="margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-width:580px;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;padding:0"></span></p><p>Everybody is curious to know about her current relationship, sources near her are not able to reveal about her personal life. To this date,&nbsp;Sue has not revealed anything about her relationships, private affairs, boyfriends, husbands or kids in any type of interviews or in any of her social accounts.</p><p>She is very low in profile while talking about personal life and is quite smart in hiding her personal details which might have given critics the idea of labeling her as a lesbian.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=199 style="margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;min-width:336px;line-height:0;margin-left:auto!important;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span>Right now she seems to be kind of ignoring her fans and followers in the process of avoiding these rumors. Although her bio states that she is a girl but she herself hasn’t revealed her sexual orientation publically.</p><p>However, there is a rumor in the air about her sexuality. Once she reposted the photo on Instagram where Nate Robinson wrote ‘Most WNBA players are ugly lesbians’. Don’t know what she wanted to say or what the re-post meant. Was she offended by it? Or was she supporting it? Only she has the idea of it.</p><p>According to the information, she does not have a husband so divorce is out of context. However, in 2002, there were heavy talks that Sue Bird was dating the one of the Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter. The News Started flying around after Sue and Carter were seen together in the EPSY award function.</p><p>Later Sue clarified <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">that there was nothing as romantic between them</a> and said the reason why they were together in the award function was a publicity stunt arranged by their mutual agent. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=600 style="margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:580px;min-height:400px;line-height:0;margin-top:15px!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;max-width:580px;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:580px;float:none!important"></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Caption:&nbsp;Sue Bird and Nick Carter arrive together at the ESPY Awards.</strong></p><p>Source: gettyimages.com</p><p>It's sad they didn't date because look for yourself, don't they look beautiful? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=601 style="margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-width:336px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-height:400px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Despite all the rumors, a source proclaims that Sue Bird has an ideal image of a husband in her mind. She said that she prefers her husband to be the sort of man who is self-assured, broadminded and doesn’t take himself seriously. We wish she gets married to a man who comes out as she wants.</p><p>Well, at this current time no one knows what exactly her sexual preference is or her plans about getting married but we are sure when the right time comes, things will come out on their own and we will make sure you know about everything related to her personal life.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=602 style="margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:336px;max-width:580px;padding:0;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;min-height:400px;line-height:0;float:none!important;display:block!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span>She is currently busy with her career and is focused in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">upcoming 2016 summer Olympic where she will represent U.S</a>&nbsp;and is all ready for a match to happen between the&nbsp;United States and Senegal today at 8:45 PM and all the fans are counting on in the Rio 2016 summer Olympics is&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>the duo of Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi</a>.
