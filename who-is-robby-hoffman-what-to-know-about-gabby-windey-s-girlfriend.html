During her Bachelorette journey, Windey got engaged to <a href=#><strong>Erich Schwer</strong></a>, but <a href=#>the twosome called it quits</a> less than two months after the season 19 finale aired. (Windey revealed during <a href=#>an August 2023 appearance on The View</a> that Schwer didn’t know about her relationship with Hoffman before the couple went public.)</p><p>Hoffman, who has long been open about her sexuality, reacted to the relationship reveal via her Instagram Story as Windey’s status made headlines. “Guys some news … I am gay,” she teased alongside a photo of her and Windey kissing.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Hoffman:</p><h3>Where Is Robby Hoffman From?</h3><p>Hoffman was born in Brooklyn.
